# ATTinyX5 Programmer
A programmer for the ATTiny 35/45/85 series of microcontrollers. Uses an Arduino Nano v3 board as the ISP interface and has a test LED for the ATTiny located on pin PB3.

Currently, this version of the hardware will work with the DIP-8 package of those particular microcontrollers.

### License
All board designs, Gerber files, schematics, etc., are licensed under the Open Source Hardware (OSHW) 1.0 license. 

### About the Hardware
In order to make the programmer compact, SMD components were used in its design. See the BOM for complete listings of materials. The total cost for components, minus the Nano and ATTiny, comes to about $3.50 USD total as of the writing of this document.

### Solder Stencil DXF
A DXF of the PCB is included to create 3D printable solder stencils. The holes in the PCB design are included to allow for proper board alignment like fiducials.
